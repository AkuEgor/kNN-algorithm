NAI - Artificial Intelligence Tools

Course Assignment

This program is my implementation of kNN( k-nearest neighbors) algorithm for Iris flowers dataset.

## What's it all about?

Program reads the data from training set of  characteristics and names of 4 species of Iris flower, asks about k number and task of the program is to find(with highest accuracy) specie of new unknown flower, knowing only its characteristics, or to classify each case from the test set.

## How to Run?

* *Run Code*

You can decide to run program on test file or your own input data
### Running through the test file:
* *Enter name of the train file:* 
```
train.txt
```
* *Enter name of the test file:* 
```
test.txt
```
* *Enter the K value (number of neighbors)*

### Running through your own input:
* *Enter 4 characteristics of a flower(Ex. 4.5,3.6,2.5,4.6)*
* *Enter name of your flower*
* *Enter the K value (number of neighbors)*
